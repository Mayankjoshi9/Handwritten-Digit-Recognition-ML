# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Machine Learning

This project is a part of the Math Garden application, designed to recognize handwritten digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The recognized digits are used to check answers to math questions drawn by users on a canvas.

## Math Garden

The Math Garden application is an interactive web application aimed at helping users practice basic math skills in a fun and engaging way. Users can draw their answers to math questions on a canvas, and the application checks their answers using a machine learning model.
